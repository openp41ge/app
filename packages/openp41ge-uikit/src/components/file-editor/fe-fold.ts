/**
 * fe-fold — indentation-based fold-region detection for the file editor.
 *
 * The file editor folds by INDENTATION (like VS Code's "indentation" folding
 * strategy): a line is a fold header when the next non-blank line is more
 * indented, and the region runs from the header down to the last line that is
 * still more indented than the header (a sibling to the header ends it). This
 * works uniformly across brace languages (JS/TS/JSON/CSS), Python, and other
 * indentation-sensitive code — no parser needed.
 *
 * Only the *shape* of the region is computed here (which model lines it
 * covers). Collapse state and the actual line hiding live in the editor.
