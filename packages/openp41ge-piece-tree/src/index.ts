/**
 * openp41ge-piece-tree — Red-black tree-based piece table for efficient text editing.
 *
 * A pure data structure that stores document text as a tree of "pieces",
 * where each piece references a sub-range of a string buffer. This enables
 * O(log n) insert and delete operations rather than O(n) string rebuilding.
 *
 * Based on the architecture of VS Code's PieceTreeBase.
