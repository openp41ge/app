/**
 * TabActivationHistory — per-window tab activation log for back/forward nav.
 *
 * A monotonic, append-only log of tab activations. Every activation — opening
 * a tab, clicking / refocusing an already-open tab, double-clicking an item in
 * the tree, or navigating with Back/Forward — appends a NEW entry to the log,
 * **even if that tab appeared earlier**. The log may therefore contain the
 * same tab more than once, in the exact order it was activated.
 *
 * The log is immutable once created: closing a tab does NOT remove its
 * entries. Back/Forward cycle the log in order, skipping entries whose tab is
 * no longer open (per the `isOpen` predicate), never re-opening a closed tab.
 *
 * `position` is the index of the entry for the tab currently focused. A
 * closed tab may still be the last-focused entry; navigation simply skips over
 * it.
 *
 * API:
 *   pushActivation(windowId, tabId)   — append an activation (no-op if the tab
 *                                       is already the focused/current one)
 *   goBack(windowId, isOpen?) → tabId|null
 *   goForward(windowId, isOpen?) → tabId|null
 *   canGoBack / canGoForward(windowId, isOpen?) → boolean
 *   getCurrent(windowId) → tabId|null
 *   getHistory(windowId) → string[] (copy, oldest → newest)
 *   clear(windowId)
 *   _reset()
