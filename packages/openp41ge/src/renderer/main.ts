// Initialize Sentry in the renderer as early as possible. The DSN and
// environment are forwarded from the main process (which owns the real DSN),
// so no dsn is passed here. `@sentry/electron` routes renderer events to the
// main process for delivery (via IPC / the sentry-ipc protocol), and when the
// main has no DSN configured it stays disabled and this is a safe no-op.
// The release/environment are the build-time baked values so the renderer's
// own client is consistent with the main client (delivery still goes through
// main, but it removes any release mismatch).

  release: __OPENP41GE_VERSION__,
