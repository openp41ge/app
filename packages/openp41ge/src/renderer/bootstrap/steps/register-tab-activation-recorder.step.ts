/**
 * RegisterTabActivationRecorderStep — records *new* tab activations into
 * TabActivationHistory.
 *
 * Tab clicks and "activate an existing tab" actions are recorded at the point
 * of dispatch (grid-activate in Openp41geTabsEventHandler, and activateTabInCell
 * in CommandBus). This step covers the one activation that cannot be known at
 * dispatch time: opening a **brand-new** tab, because the new tab id is only
 * generated in the main process and only becomes visible once the workspace
 * state updates.
 *
 * It observes the workspace state and records tabs that newly appear. Crucially
 * it does NOT record active-tab *switches* — closing a tab sets the survivor
 * active, and back/forward navigation also changes the active tab, neither of
 * which is a fresh activation. The very first state observation is used as a
 * baseline and seeds only the grid's currently-active tab as the history's
 * current position (not a navigation chain), so Cmd+W and Back/Forward have a
 * correct starting point for a restored workspace.
