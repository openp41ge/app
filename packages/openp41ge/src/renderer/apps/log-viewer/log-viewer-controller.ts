/**
 * Log viewer controller — mounts <openp41ge-log-viewer> as a pane.
 *
 * The viewer reads the **persisted** daily log files under `<dataDir>/logs`
 * via `LogFilePageReader` (backward paging: newest at the bottom, older pages
 * loaded as the user scrolls up). Logs therefore survive dev hot-reloads and
 * app restarts instead of being reset on every reload.
 *
 * If the `log:read-backward` IPC isn't available (no preload bridge, or a
 * stale main process), `LogFilePageReader.loadLatest` throws and the viewer
 * falls back to the in-memory bus — so a stale main process can't flood the
 * error overlay.
 *
 * A `system` config is passed through but the viewer shows all logs in
 * datetime order (no grouping).
