/**
 * openp41ge-sentry — Sentry (error monitoring) init for the Electron main
 * process.
 *
 * This module is imported ONLY by electron-process entry code
 * (`electron/main.ts`). It depends on the `electron` module (`app`), and must
 * stay out of the import graph of `src/main/services/*` so unit tests
 * (which run without Electron) never load it.
 *
 * The manager / workspace windows (renderers) forward their errors to the main
 * process over Sentry's IPC (see `@sentry/electron`), so this single
 * main-process init is the one place with the real DSN. The renderer SDK only
 * needs a bare `Sentry.init()`; the DSN and environment are propagated by
 * `@sentry/electron` itself and sent with the main client.
 *
 * The DSN is baked in as the default (Sentry DSNs are public client-side
 * identifiers, not secrets). It can still be overridden at runtime with the
 * `OPENP41GE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable (useful for dev / pointing at a
 * different project); when the env var is set to an empty value, Sentry is
 * left disabled entirely — no network calls, no event capture.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: `Sentry.init()` MUST run before Electron's `app` "ready" event —
 * the SDK registers the `sentry-ipc` privileged scheme and IPC/protocol
 * handlers during init, and the scheme registration is only allowed before
 * ready. That is why `initSentry()` is called from `electron/main.ts` at module
 * load, ahead of `Openp41geApplication.start()`.
